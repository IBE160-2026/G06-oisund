# Development log

## 2026-09-21 – Project setup

### Work completed

- Cloned the assigned GitHub repository.
- Configured Git identity and verified the remote repository.
- Installed BMAD v6.12.0 according to Appendix B.
- Installed BMAD Core and BMad Method (BMM).
- Configured 29 BMAD skills for OpenAI Codex.
- Verified that the installation did not modify the existing README or `.gitignore`.
- Committed and pushed the setup to the `main` branch.

### AI use

OpenAI Codex was used to inspect Appendix B, run the BMAD installer, and verify the resulting files and Git status. All commands requiring changes were approved by the student.

### Verification

- BMAD installation completed without errors.
- Local branch was synchronized with `origin/main`.
- Working tree was clean after push.
- Setup commit: `23d620d`.

## 2026-09-21 – Product Brief

### Work completed

- Completed the BMAD Product Brief workflow for the bus-driver assistant.
- Defined the problem, users, MVP scope, success criteria, risks and broader vision.
- Separated the concise Product Brief from supporting evidence in an addendum.
- Sanitized supporting documentation before publication in the public repository.

### AI use

OpenAI Codex and the BMAD Product Brief workflow were used to facilitate structured discovery, inspect supplied course material and shift-report samples, draft the documents and perform editorial and privacy checks. Product decisions and scope priorities were approved by the student.

### Verification

- `brief.md` and `product-brief.md` were verified as identical.
- No code, PRD or architecture was created.
- Local paths and private operational identifiers were removed before publication.

## 2026-09-21 – Product Requirements Document

### Work completed

- Completed the guided BMAD Create PRD workflow for the bus-driver assistant.
- Defined and approved 25 functional requirements and four non-functional requirement groups.
- Clarified the course MVP, deferred capabilities and downstream technical validation.
- Reconciled the PRD with the Product Brief, source research and recorded decisions.
- Completed consistency, editorial and privacy reviews.
- Approved the PRD as final.

### AI use

OpenAI Codex with GPT-6 Astra and the BMAD PRD workflow facilitated requirements discovery, source research, drafting, adversarial review, reconciliation and privacy checks. Product decisions were reviewed and approved by the student.

### Time spent

Approximately 4.5 hours on guided PRD development and finalization.

## 2026-09-22 – UX design and validation

### Work completed

- Completed and approved the BMAD UX workflow using all five source documents, with the PRD and its addendum taking precedence over the briefs.
- Finalized English `DESIGN.md` and `EXPERIENCE.md`, five approved HTML references including a navigable 43-screen gallery, consolidated HTML/Markdown validation reports, reviewer reports, source reconciliation and decision history.
- Established landscape tablet layouts in Day A/Night C, vertical upcoming-first stops, current/next-stop emphasis, a persistent clock, relevant disruption headings and explicit data uncertainty.
- Confirmed PDF/image import, split working days with one summary, partial shift updates, persistent manual theme selection and an underlined active Auto control. Menu restrictions and the five-minute GPS-loss countdown remain explicit.
- Defined separate FADDER/INSTRUKTØR assignments, own driving and accompanied plans, explicit driver takeover, and accompanied-only summary/PDF evidence. Accompanied-person source files are deleted after import; necessary interpreted information remains in the mentor's working day.

### AI use

OpenAI Codex and the BMAD UX workflow supported iterative sketches, document drafting, source reconciliation and three user-selected validation lenses: document consistency/coverage, driver-position readability/interaction, and operational edge cases/role changes/data trust. The student reviewed the sketches, made product decisions and approved the completed UX and validation.

### Verification

- All 11 distinct validation findings were addressed; original reviewer reports and resolution records are preserved.
- Static checks verified token references, local/source links, paired component names and sketch navigation. Browser inspection checked clock placement and the active Auto underline.
- Mounted-device readability, touch, browser/sensor support and implemented behavior still require practical verification.
- Temporary browser profiles/caches, preview images and one-off working files are excluded from Git. Final documents, approved sketches, validation/reviewer reports, source tracing and the UX memlog are retained.
- No architecture or application implementation was started.

## 2026-09-23 – Step 4: Architecture completed

### Work completed

- Finalized the [Architecture Spine](../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture/architecture-IBE160-2026-09-23/ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md) using the approved Product Brief, PRD and UX as authoritative inputs.
- The student approved architecture decisions AD-1–AD-14 through the interactive BMAD Architecture workflow.
- Defined the V1 boundaries, modular monolith, React/TypeScript client, Python/FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL, six conceptual contracts and local operational authority with offline synchronization.
- Recorded import, source uncertainty, notice lifecycle, access, writer transfer, retention and compatible-release rules, together with portable Docker Compose delivery on the Windows desktop, Cloudflare access and an isolated fictional demo.
- Retained the decision log, source reconciliation and independent review reports with the finalized architecture.

### AI use

OpenAI Codex and the BMAD Architecture workflow supported interactive decisions, official-source research, document drafting, source reconciliation and independent architecture reviews. The student approved the architecture decisions and their constraints.

### Verification and remaining pilot prerequisites

- Reconciled the architecture with Product Brief, PRD, DESIGN and EXPERIENCE. Addressed the independent reviewers' findings; the final document lint reported zero findings.
- Architecture approval does not establish pilot readiness. OCR on representative anonymized files, actual Entur/Svipper-origin coverage and relevance, Lenovo/Brave GPS and interaction behavior, offline recovery, synchronization/conflicts, deletion and release compatibility still require implementation tests.
- Cloudflare Access renewal/expiry, trusted HTTPS over mobile networks, private/demo isolation, Windows restart recovery and acceptable desktop resource use/noise must also be tested before real-shift pilot use.
- No application implementation, external service provisioning or deployment was performed in this step.

### Next step

**Step 5: Epics & Stories**, based on the approved Product Brief, PRD, UX and Architecture Spine. Step 4 is complete. Neither BMAD Spec nor Epics & Stories is started in this session.
